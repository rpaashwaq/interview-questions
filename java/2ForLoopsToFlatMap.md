Take an example of city and states dependent data. Instead of looping two for loops, can we use flat map to get in java.

I'd be glad to help you with that. Here's how you can use flatMap in Java to efficiently retrieve city and state data without nested loops:
Data Structure:
Let's assume you have a Map<String, List<String>> where the key is the state name and the value is a list of cities in that state.
```java
Map<String, List<String>> stateCityMap = new HashMap<>();
stateCityMap.put("California", Arrays.asList("Los Angeles", "San Francisco", "San Diego"));
stateCityMap.put("New York", Arrays.asList("New York City", "Buffalo", "Rochester"));
```
// ... add more states and cities

Using flatMap:
```java
List<String> cities = stateCityMap.values()
                                  .stream()
                                  .flatMap(List::stream)
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Explanation:

 * stateCityMap.values(): Gets a collection of all the city lists.

 * .stream(): Converts the collection into a stream.

 * .flatMap(List::stream): Flattens the stream of city lists into a stream of individual cities.

 * .collect(Collectors.toList()): Collects the stream of cities into a list.

Example Usage:
```java
System.out.println("All cities:");
cities.forEach(System.out::println);
```
This code will output:
Los Angeles
San Francisco
San Diego
New York City
Buffalo
Rochester

Benefits of using flatMap:
 * Concise and readable: The code is more concise and easier to understand compared to nested loops.
 * Efficient: flatMap is often more efficient than nested loops, especially for large datasets.
 * Functional style: It promotes a functional programming style, which can be beneficial for certain use cases.
By using flatMap, you can effectively retrieve city and state data without the need for nested loops, making your code more efficient and readable.
