Best way to read an excel with 1 million records and insert into DB

## Efficiently Reading a Large Excel File and Inserting into a Database

**Understanding the Challenge:**

When dealing with a large Excel file containing 1 million records, the primary concern is performance. Reading the entire file into memory at once can be resource-intensive and potentially lead to out-of-memory errors.

**Recommended Approach: Batch Processing**

1. **Use a Streaming API:**

   - **Apache POI:** A popular Java library for working with various file formats, including Excel. Its streaming API allows you to process data in chunks, minimizing memory usage.
   - **OpenCSV:** A CSV parser that supports streaming, making it suitable for large CSV files (if your Excel file is in CSV format).

2. **Batch Inserts:**
   - **JDBC Batch Statements:** Instead of executing individual insert statements for each row, use batch statements to group multiple inserts together. This significantly reduces network overhead and database server load.
   - **ORM Frameworks:** If you're using an ORM like Hibernate or JPA, they often provide built-in batching support.

**Code Example (Using Apache POI and JDBC Batch Statements):**

```java
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.*;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.sql.*;

public class ExcelToDB {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String excelFilePath = "path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx";
        String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
        String username = "your_username";
        String password = "your_password";

        try (Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new FileInputStream(excelFilePath));
             Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, username, password);
             PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)")) {

            Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); // Assuming data is in the first sheet

            int batchSize = 1000; // Adjust batch size as needed
            int count = 0;

            for (Row row : sheet) {
                // Skip header row if present
                if (row.getRowNum() == 0) {
                    continue;
                }

                // Set values for prepared statement
                // ...

                statement.addBatch();
                count++;

                if (count % batchSize == 0) {
                    statement.executeBatch();
                    count = 0;
                }
            }

            // Execute remaining batch
            if (count > 0) {
                statement.executeBatch();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are created on the database table to optimize query performance.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and handle failed inserts gracefully.
- **Memory Management:** Monitor memory usage during the process and adjust batch size or other parameters if necessary.
- **Parallel Processing:** For very large files, consider using multiple threads or processes to parallelize the reading and insertion operations.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the capabilities of streaming APIs and batch processing, you can efficiently handle large Excel files and insert their data into a database.
