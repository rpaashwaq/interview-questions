Explain about Comparator chaining?

**Comparator chaining** in Java refers to the process of combining multiple `Comparator` objects to perform **multi-level sorting** of a collection. This is useful when sorting by one criterion isnâ€™t enough, and you need to add secondary (or tertiary, etc.) sorting criteria in case two elements are considered equal based on the first criterion.

Java 8 introduced convenient methods for `Comparator` chaining, particularly the `thenComparing()` method, which allows you to chain multiple comparators together.

### How Comparator Chaining Works

1. **Primary Comparator**: Compares elements based on the first criterion.
2. **Secondary Comparator**: If two elements are considered equal by the primary comparator, this comparator is used.
3. **Tertiary Comparator** (optional): If the first two comparators determine that the elements are still equal, you can add additional comparators.

### Example: Comparator Chaining in Action

Suppose we have a `Person` class with three attributes: `name`, `age`, and `salary`. We want to sort a list of `Person` objects first by `age`, and then, if two persons have the same age, by `salary`.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    public Person(String name, int age, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (" + age + " years old, $" + salary + " salary)";
    }
}

public class ComparatorChainingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = Arrays.asList(
                new Person("John", 25, 3000),
                new Person("Alice", 25, 2500),
                new Person("Bob", 22, 4000),
                new Person("David", 25, 3000),
                new Person("Carol", 22, 3000)
        );

        // Comparator chaining: first by age, then by salary, then by name
        Comparator<Person> personComparator = Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)
                                                        .thenComparing(Person::getSalary)
                                                        .thenComparing(Person::getName);

        Collections.sort(people, personComparator);

        // Output the sorted list
        people.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Breaking Down the Comparator Chaining:

1. **Primary Comparator**: `Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)` sorts by age.
2. **Secondary Comparator**: `.thenComparing(Person::getSalary)` is used if two persons have the same age, sorting by salary.
3. **Tertiary Comparator**: `.thenComparing(Person::getName)` is used if two persons have the same age and salary, sorting by name as a final tie-breaker.

### Output:

```
Bob (22 years old, $4000.0 salary)
Carol (22 years old, $3000.0 salary)
Alice (25 years old, $2500.0 salary)
David (25 years old, $3000.0 salary)
John (25 years old, $3000.0 salary)
```

### Example of Reversing a Comparator

You can also reverse the sorting order for any comparator using `Comparator.reversed()`:

```java
Comparator<Person> personComparator = Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)
                                                .reversed()            // Sort by age in descending order
                                                .thenComparing(Person::getSalary)  // Sort by salary (ascending)
                                                .thenComparing(Person::getName);   // Sort by name (ascending)
```

This will sort the list by descending age, then ascending salary, then ascending name.

### Key Methods for Comparator Chaining

1. **`thenComparing(Comparator)`**:

   - Chains another `Comparator` to be used when the previous comparator considers elements equal.

2. **`thenComparing(Function keyExtractor)`**:

   - Takes a function that extracts a key and creates a comparator for that key. Similar to `Comparator.comparing()`.

3. **`thenComparing(Function keyExtractor, Comparator)`**:

   - Allows specifying both a key extractor and a custom comparator for sorting the key.

4. **`Comparator.reversed()`**:
   - Reverses the order of the comparator.

### Example: Custom Sorting

You can use a custom comparator in `thenComparing` if you need more control over how values are compared:

```java
Comparator<Person> personComparator = Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)
                                                .thenComparing((p1, p2) -> Double.compare(p1.getSalary(), p2.getSalary()))
                                                .thenComparing(Person::getName);
```

This is equivalent to the earlier example, but here, we are explicitly specifying the comparison logic for the salary field using `Double.compare`.

### Summary

- **Comparator chaining** allows you to sort objects by multiple fields or criteria.
- The **`thenComparing()`** method is used to add secondary and tertiary comparators.
- You can combine comparators with ascending or descending order using methods like `Comparator.reversed()`.
- Comparator chaining is powerful for complex sorting scenarios where multiple levels of comparison are required.
