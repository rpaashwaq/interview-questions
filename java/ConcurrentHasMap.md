Difference between ConcurrentHashMap vs HashMap

## ConcurrentHashMap vs HashMap

| Feature | ConcurrentHashMap | HashMap |
|---|---|---|
| **Thread Safety** | Thread-safe | Not thread-safe |
| **Performance** | Generally better performance for concurrent operations due to internal segmentation | May suffer from performance degradation in multi-threaded environments due to synchronization overhead |
| **Use Cases** | Suitable for concurrent applications where multiple threads need to access the map simultaneously | Primarily used in single-threaded or read-only scenarios |
| **Internal Structure** | Divided into segments for concurrent access | Single data structure for all operations |
| **Synchronization** | Uses locks at the segment level for finer-grained control | Uses a single lock for the entire map |
| **Iteration** | Iterates over a snapshot of the map, providing a consistent view | Iterates over the live map, which can lead to ConcurrentModificationException if the map is modified during iteration |

**In summary:**

* **ConcurrentHashMap** is designed for concurrent access and offers better performance in multi-threaded environments.
* **HashMap** is simpler and more efficient in single-threaded or read-only scenarios but can suffer from performance degradation in concurrent environments.

The choice between ConcurrentHashMap and HashMap depends on the specific requirements of your application, particularly the level of concurrency and the need for thread safety.
