what is functional interface, what is advantage, relation between functional interface and lambda expressions

I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive explanation of functional interfaces, their advantages, and their relationship to lambda expressions:

**Functional Interfaces**

In Java 8, a functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. This abstract method is implicitly public, and it is the only method that can be overridden by classes that implement the interface.

**Advantages of Functional Interfaces:**

1. **Concise and Readable Code:** Functional interfaces allow you to write more concise and readable code by using lambda expressions, which are anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments to methods or stored in variables.
2. **Improved Code Reusability:** Functional interfaces can be used to define reusable code patterns, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.
3. **Enhanced Flexibility:** Functional interfaces can be used to create flexible and adaptable code that can be customized to different use cases.
4. **Integration with Streams API:** Functional interfaces are essential for working with the Java Streams API, which provides a powerful way to process collections of data in a declarative style.

**Relationship Between Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions**

Functional interfaces and lambda expressions are closely related. A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an instance of a functional interface. When you pass a lambda expression to a method that accepts a functional interface as an argument, the lambda expression is automatically converted into an instance of the functional interface at runtime.

**Example:**

```java
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void doSomething(String message);
}

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFunctionalInterface myInterface = (message) -> System.out.println(message);
        myInterface.doSomething("Hello from lambda!");
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyFunctionalInterface` is a functional interface with a single abstract method `doSomething`. The lambda expression `(message) -> System.out.println(message)` is assigned to the `myInterface` variable, and when `myInterface.doSomething("Hello from lambda!")` is called, the lambda expression is executed.

**Common Built-in Functional Interfaces:**

- `Runnable` (single abstract method: `run()`)
- `Callable<T>` (single abstract method: `call()`)
- `Consumer<T>` (single abstract method: `accept(T)`)
- `Supplier<T>` (single abstract method: `get()`)
- `Function<T, R>` (single abstract method: `apply(T)`)
- `Predicate<T>` (single abstract method: `test(T)`)

These interfaces are widely used in Java 8 and beyond, providing a convenient way to work with functional programming concepts.
