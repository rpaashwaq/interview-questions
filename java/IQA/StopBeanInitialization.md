In spring boot, how to stop bean getting initialized

In Spring Boot, you can prevent a bean from being initialized using several methods, depending on your specific requirements. Here are some common approaches:

### 1. **Conditional Annotations**

You can use Spring's conditional annotations to control whether a bean is initialized based on some condition. Examples include:

- **`@ConditionalOnProperty`**: Only initialize the bean if a specific property is set in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

  ```java
  @Bean
  @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "my.bean.enabled", havingValue = "true")
  public MyBean myBean() {
      return new MyBean();
  }
  ```

- **`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`**: Only initialize the bean if a particular bean is missing in the Spring context.

  ```java
  @Bean
  @ConditionalOnMissingBean(MyOtherBean.class)
  public MyBean myBean() {
      return new MyBean();
  }
  ```

- **`@Conditional`**: Create a custom condition for more complex logic.
  ```java
  @Bean
  @Conditional(MyCustomCondition.class)
  public MyBean myBean() {
      return new MyBean();
  }
  ```

### 2. **Profile-Based Bean Initialization**

You can use `@Profile` to control bean initialization based on the active profile.

```java
@Bean
@Profile("dev")
public MyBean myDevBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
```

In this case, the bean will only be initialized if the active profile is "dev".

### 3. **Remove the Bean Definition**

Simply remove the bean definition if it’s not needed in your context. You can also programmatically register or unregister beans using a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`.

### 4. **Lazy Initialization**

If you just want to delay the initialization of a bean until it’s actually needed, you can use `@Lazy`.

```java
@Bean
@Lazy
public MyBean myLazyBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
```

This doesn’t stop the bean from being created entirely, but it delays its creation until it’s required.

Choose the method that best fits your needs. For example, if you want to conditionally initialize a bean based on a configuration, using `@ConditionalOnProperty` is usually the most straightforward solution.
