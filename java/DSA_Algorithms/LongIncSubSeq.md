Finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
```
Understanding the Problem:
 * We're given an array of integers.
 * We need to find the longest subsequence of elements that are strictly increasing.
 * We only need to return the length of this subsequence.

Approach: Dynamic Programming
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. We can use a bottom-up approach to solve it efficiently.

Algorithm:
 * Initialize: Create an array dp of the same size as the input array A. This array will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index. Initialize all elements of dp to 1, as each element can be considered a subsequence of length 1.
 * Iterate: Iterate through the input array A from index 1 to the end:
   * For each element A[i], iterate through all previous elements A[j] (where j < i).
   * If A[j] is less than A[i], it means A[i] can be added to the increasing subsequence ending at A[j]. Update dp[i] to the maximum of its current value and dp[j] + 1.
 * Find Maximum: After iterating through the entire array, the maximum value in the dp array will be the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Code Implementation (Python):
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(A):
    n = len(A)
    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize DP array with 1s

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if A[j] < A[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)
```

Code Implementation (Java):
```java

import java.util.Arrays;

public class LongestIncreasingSubsequence {
    public static int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return Arrays.stream(dp).max().getAsInt();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18};
        int length = lengthOfLIS(nums);
        System.out.println("Length of the longest increasing subsequence: " + length);
    }
}

```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Explanation:
 * The outer loop iterates n times.
 * The inner loop iterates at most i times for each outer loop iteration.
 * In the worst case, the inner loop iterates n-1 times for the last outer loop iteration.
 * Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n * (n-1)) â‰ˆ O(n^2).
This dynamic programming approach provides an efficient solution to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given array.
